# RPG Game

This is a a role playing game with heroes and monsters. There is no graphical user interface yet. All the action takes place on a 2D grid. There is a group of heroes (or perhaps a solo hero) whose porpuse is to wander around the grid and face mosters, fight them and get money and experience, which will allow them to upgrade their skills and equipment. The grid consist of common squares, where monsters may appearor or not with a certain frequency, non-accessible squares and market squares, where the heroes can buy or sell items to enrich their inventory. There are several types of heroes and monsters, spells and weapons, each one with different strengths and weaknesses. In a battle, in every round, every hero and monster makes one move, either to attack an enemy using a weapon or a spell, or to equip with different weapons or use magic potions. The battle ends when all monsters or all heroes have lost their entire health power. The game doesn't have a winning or losing condition. One can play until he gets bored. Have fun!
